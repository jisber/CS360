And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men?
