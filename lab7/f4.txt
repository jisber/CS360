Strooolling slooowly tooowards the sun
Soooooothing every wave that cooomes
dressed in looove she lives fooor life tooo be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and looonely looovers free

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men?
