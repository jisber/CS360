Meet me in the playgrooound at a quarter tooo fooour 
Wait till everybooody's looong gooone 
There must be sooo many things that we can explooore 
Maybe I can walk yooou hooome 
If it starts tooo rain - we can take sooome shelter 
I'd like tooo hooold yooour little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get tooo knooow each ooother if we can 
I don't have your phone number, honey
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I've been working on it baby
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
     1	Strolling slowly towards the sun
     2	Soothing every wave that comes
     3	dressed in love she lives for life to be
     4	feels like I never see
     5	Setting suns and lonely lovers free
     6	
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
Hi
Meet me in the playgrooound at a quarter tooo fooour 
Wait till everybooody's looong gooone 
There must be sooo many things that we can explooore 
Maybe I can walk yooou hooome 
If it starts tooo rain - we can take sooome shelter 
I'd like tooo hooold yooour little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get tooo knooow each ooother if we can 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
I don't have your phone number, honey
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I've been working on it baby
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?

We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
I don't have your phone number, honey

Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
